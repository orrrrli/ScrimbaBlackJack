##Blackjack Game JavaScript Code

This readme.txt provides an explanation of the JavaScript code for a simple Blackjack game.

### Description

The provided JavaScript code implements a basic Blackjack game. It defines a `player` object with a `name` and `chips` properties, an array `cards` to hold the player's cards, and several variables to keep track of the game state. The game displays the player's cards and their total sum, and allows the player to draw a new card until they reach 21 or go over.

### Code Overview

1. `player` object: Represents the player with properties `name` and `chips`. It holds the player's name and initial chips count.

2. `cards` array: An array to store the player's cards.

3. `sum` variable: Keeps track of the sum of the player's cards.

4. `hasBlackJack` variable: Indicates whether the player has achieved Blackjack (sum of 21).

5. `isAlive` variable: Indicates whether the player is still in the game or has gone over 21.

6. `message` variable: Stores different messages based on the game state.

7. `messageEl`, `sumEl`, `cardsEl`, and `playerEl`: Elements in the HTML file where the game messages, sum, cards, and player details will be displayed.

8. `getRandomCard()` function: Generates a random card value between 1 and 11, where cards with values greater than 10 are considered as 10, and a card value of 1 is considered as 11.

9. `startGame()` function: Initializes the game by setting `isAlive` to true, drawing two random cards, and updating the `sum` variable.

10. `renderGame()` function: Updates the display of cards, sum, and game messages based on the current game state.

11. `newCard()` function: Draws a new card for the player if the game is still active and has not achieved Blackjack.

### How to Use the Code

To use this code, you need to integrate it with an HTML file that includes elements with ids "message-el", "sum-el", "cards-el", and "player-el" where the game messages, sum, cards, and player details will be displayed. Then, you can call the `startGame()` function to begin the game, and the player can draw new cards by clicking on a button that calls the `newCard()` function.

The code is a basic implementation of Blackjack and can be further extended with additional features, such as dealer logic, betting, and more interactive user interfaces.

**Note:** The code provided here is intended for educational purposes and may require additional improvements and validation for a complete production-ready Blackjack game.
